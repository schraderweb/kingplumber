      <h2>Drain Cleaning</h2>
      
       
       
   <p>Nothing is worse than finding yourself in a situation in which you have sewer coming back up from your toilet, sink, bathtub, or shower. Don't fret! King Plumber knows how to address the problem & save the day. If you notice any of the following, a problem may be present in your sewer or water line & it's time to call the professional plumbers at King Plumber for a drain cleaning:</p>

    
    
    <h3>Does Your Home Have Multiple Backed Up Drains?</h3>
    <p>If one or more drains are backed up in your house, water flow does not have a clear path & will start to back-flow. It's best to catch the problem now before it escalates, so call the plumbing experts at King Plumber to have your drains unclogged ASAP.</p>

    <h3>Has Sewage Started Flowing Back Through Your Drains?</h3>
    <p>Clogs can often get forced deeper into your piping where they eventually end up in your sewer line. The sewage then cannot flow properly into the sewer system, so with nowhere to go, the sewage flows back through your kitchen & bathroom drains. Before the mess occurs, call your drain cleaning experts at King Plumber to unclog that pesky blockage.</p>

    <h3>Mainline Drains in Your Home Slower Than Usual?</h3>
    <p>Water pooling at your feet in the shower? Sink water not flowing quickly & pooling in the basin? It's likely your drain has an obstruction. 
        
        You may have some luck clearing it yourself, but most drain blockages leave debris & residue. 
To avoid this, call the experts at King Plumber to professionally clean this out.</p>

    <h3>Bad Smells & Localized Odor Coming from Your Drain?</h3>
    <p>Are you noticing an unpleasant stench around an appliance such as your tub or sink? If it's not the trash, chances are you have a buildup of 
food, organic waste, or other smelly materials in your drain that needs a clean-out.</p>

<p>No matter the problem, our King Plumber mainline drain clearing technicians will determine what needs to be addressed before any work is done, so you will know exactly what solution is best for your home's drain.</p>

          I bought a motor home parked it connected the water and had a dribble coming out of sinks & tub.
          Called King Plumber and got a courteous professional gentleman who said he did work on motor
         homes and would be glad to help. They came out, he spotted the problem (along with his co-worker)
        and proceeded to fix it promptly. They did a wonderful job in a very quick time and were very very
        reasonable. I would use them again anytime & I  highly recommend them to anyone.
