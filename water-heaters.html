<h3>How Much Does a New Hot Water Heater Installation Cost?</h3>

<p>The cost of a brand-new water heater can vary widely depending on the type & size (in gallons) of the water heater. Prices can also vary considerably between the two types of water heaters: traditional tank & tankless. In addition, there are several other factors that can affect the overall cost of a water heater installation or replacement:</p>

    <h3>For many people, the long-term benefits of tankless heaters more than compensate for their initial expense. </h3>
    
    <p>A tankless heater can be up to 34% more efficient than a traditional water heater. This increase in efficiency can amount to annual savings of over $100, depending on the type and size of the heater.</p>

   <h3>What's the Difference Between a Traditional Tank Water Heater & a Tankless Water Heater?</h3>
    
    <p>A traditional tank water heater stores gallons of water, so hot water is always available. A tankless water heater will heat up water on-demand, which will save you money in energy costs down the road. Traditional storage tank water heaters are much easier & cheaper to install.</p>

    <h3>Is Gas or Electric a Better Fuel Source?</h3>
    <p>This decision can be heavily dependent on your geographic location & local natural gas and electricity costs. However, it's generally a bit more expensive for a gas water heater than an electric water heater.</p>

    <h3>What Size Water Heater Does Your Home Need?</h3>
    <p>Traditional tank-style water heaters can range from 20- to 80-gallon tanks, with 40-gallon being the most common. Keep in mind, the larger the tank, the more costly will be for the unit itself & the heating costs. Let the plumbing experts at King Plumbing help you decide which option is best for your home with an installation evaluation & cost estimate today!</p>

<p>No matter what your hot water needs are, our expert plumbers will determine the best water heater type & size for your home with professional advice on your installation before any work is done. You'll know exactly what solution is best & most affordable for your new water heater; that's our guarantee.</p>

<h3>King Plumber is proud to say that we offer one of the most economically priced Hot Water Heater replacement packages in the Tulsa area. Starting at only $1,900* for a 40-50 gallon tank! Our promise to you is to perform the correct water heater installation at an honest price.</h3>

          I bought a motor home parked it connected the water and had a dribble coming out of sinks & tub.
          Called King Plumber and got a courteous professional gentleman who said he did work on motor
         homes and would be glad to help. They came out, he spotted the problem (along with his co-worker)
        and proceeded to fix it promptly. They did a wonderful job in a very quick time and were very very
        reasonable. I would use them again anytime & I  highly recommend them to anyone.
